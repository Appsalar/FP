test 1 
encoding small string
8 bytes -> 3 bytes + 20 bytes overhead = 23 bytes
1 : 2.8 compression

test 2
encoding itself 
1951 bytes -> 1258 bytes  + 214 bytes  overhead = 1472 bytes
1.3 : 1 compression

test 3 
encoding large file
56.9 mB -> 42.3 mB + less than 1000 bytes overhead
1.35 : 1 compression
